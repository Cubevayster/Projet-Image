    """
    Divide a 2D image into smaller patches in order to avoid pixels loss. The function finds the best way to split the image with the least overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image: the 2d (m, n) image to be split;
    patch_size: the size of a single patch;
    step: if set to None it automatically detects the best split with overlap and without excluding pixels, otherwise it is possible to choose a fixed step size;
    verbose: if True returns the parameters of interest such as: Number of patches, overlapping pixels, step size and pixels excluded.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> image = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
    >>> patches, step = image2patch(image, (2, 2), None)  # split image into 2*2 small 2*2 patches with 0 overlap in the x axis and overlap = 1 in the y axis. 0 pixels excluded.
    >>> assert patches.shape == (2, 2, 2, 2)

    """
    Reconstruct original image from the patches. Takes into account the overlap to avoid wrong merge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patched_image: the patches to be merged. It must come from 2D image (n, m, x, y).
    original_dims: dimensions of the original image.
    step: step used to generate the overlapping patches.
    resize_flag: flag to resize the reconstructed image to its original dimensions. Useful if the patching procedure loses pixels.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])

    >>> reconstructed_arr = patch2image(patches, arr.shape, step_)
    >>> assert (reconstructed_arr == arr).all()
